# Use `exec` to replace this shell script process with the RSpec process.
# This ensures that any signals (like SIGINT from pressing Ctrl+C) are sent directly to RSpec,
# rather than being intercepted by this wrapper script.
#
# Without `exec`, the shell script would receive the signal first, and we'd have to manually
# forward it to RSpec, which can interfere with RSpec's built-in signal handling â€”
# for example, its graceful shutdown message on the first interrupt, and forced exit on the second.
#
# By using `exec`, we preserve RSpec's native behavior and avoid issues with signal forwarding.

exec bundle exec rspec "$@"
