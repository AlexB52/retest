# Retest

Retest is a small gem to help refactor code by watching a file change and running its matching spec. You don't need a configuration file to start refactoring. It is advised to be one `cmd + z` away from green tests when refactoring. This means running tests after every line change. Let Retest rerun your tests after every file change you make.

This is my take on solving tests rerun. It is meant to be simple and follow testing conventions encountered in Ruby projects. It is probably unstable and unflexible but covers my need. Give it a go you can uninstall it easily. For stable, yet more and fully fledged solutions, some cli tools already exists: [autotest](https://github.com/grosser/autotest), [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard), [zentest](https://github.com/seattlerb/zentest)

This is a work in progress and the end goal is to have an executable that works as follow:

* Works with RSpec, MiniTest, Rake commands & bash commands (not aliases).
* Works when run in a Docker container.
* When a test file is not found run the last command again.
* When multiple test files are found, ask  which file to run and save the answer.

## Installation

Install it on your machine with:

    $ gem install retest

## Usage

Launch `retest` in your terminal after accessing your ruby project folder.

Pass the test command surrounded with quotes. Use the placeholder `<test>` in your command to let `retest` find the matching test and replace the placeholder with the path of the test file.

```bash
# Let retest find the test file and replace the placeholder with the path of the test file
$ retest 'bundle exec rake test <test>'
$ retest 'rails test <test>'
$ retest 'rspec <test>'
$ retest 'ruby <test>'

# Run the same command after a file change like all the spec files
$ retest 'bundle exec rake test'
$ retest 'rails test'
$ retest 'rspec'

# Hardcode a test file to run indepdendently from the file you change
$ retest 'ruby all_tests.rb'
```

**Disclaimer:**
* If an error comes in try using `bundle exec` like so: `$ retest 'bundle exec rake test <test>'`
* Aliases saved on ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc cannot be run that way with the `retest` command

## Roadmap

- [x] MVP
- [ ] Run withing Docker.
- [ ] When a test file is not found run the last command again.
- [ ] When multiple test files are found, ask  which file to run and save the answer.
- [ ] Aliases from oh-my-zsh and bash profiles?

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
